                    <h2>RACE HISTORY</h2>
                    <p>The Border Collie is a dog of English origin and the breed was developed by sheep herders and farmers. There have been records since the middle of the 16th century, but the name was only made official in 1925 and the recognition by the American Kennel Club came in 1995. The farmers did a genetic improvement work aimed at grazing, where only the most outstanding specimens were crossed in the grazing work, that is, the most agile, silent, posture yields to the ground, and controlling the flock with the look. At that time they are not even concerned with the breed's aesthetics, but with the work and intelligence of the dogs.</p>

                    <h2>GENERAL APPEARANCE</h2>
                    <p>The Border Collie is a well balanced, medium-sized dog of athletic appearance, displaying style and agility in equal measure with soundness and strength. Its hard, muscular body conveys the impression of effortless movement and endless endurance. The Border Collie is extremely intelligent, with its keen, alert expression being a very important characteristic of the breed. Any aspect of structure or temperament that would impede the dog’s ability to function as a herding dog should be severely faulted. The Border Collie is, and should remain, a natural and unspoiled true working sheepdog whose conformation is described herein. Honorable scars and broken teeth incurred in the line of duty are acceptable..</p>

                    <h2>OCCUPATION</h2>
                    <p>Border Collies are still used today to shepherd sheep and cattle, farmers put dogs from puppies so that they already know how to behave in front of a herd, and with the shepherd dog instinct, they know exactly what to do. They are also used in beauty competitions; agility; guide dogs; company; to rescue and search for missing persons (working together with police and firefighters); drug sniffing dogs and sometimes guard dogs.</p>
